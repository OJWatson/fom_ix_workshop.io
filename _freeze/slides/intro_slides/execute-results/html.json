Encourage sharing a fun fact or what you hope to get out of today.  \n- **Common Interests**: Identify any overlapping themes or challenges. What health issues are many of us tackling? Highlight shared interests and expertise areas to spark connections.  \n- **Engagement**: *Icebreaker idea*: “In one word, what excites you about AI in medicine?” – a quick round to warm up the room and get everyone talking.\n\n---\n\n# Working Groups - Group around tables { .smaller-slide}\n\n\n```{css, echo=FALSE}\n#color-slide, \n#smaller-slide p {\n font-size: 20px;\n}\n```\n\n\n- **Group 1: Health Policy and Resource Planning**  \n    - Ana Espinosa-Gonzalez, Rachel Christie, Margherita Molaro, Ahmed Alboksmaty, Kelly Zhang, Tricia Tay  \n\n- **Group 2: Digital Health and Clinical Informatics**  \n  - Jane Hirst, Thomas Beaney, Reham Aldakhil, Brendan Delaney, Hamed Haddadi  \n\n- **Group 3: Infectious Disease Modeling and Epidemiology**  \n  - Oliver (OJ) Watson, Charlie Whittaker, Kris Parag, Elizaveta Semenova, Becca Asquith, Manolo Perez, Fadil Bidmos  \n\n- **Group 4: Cardiovascular, Respiratory, and Environmental Health**  \n  - Fan Chung, Dennis Wang, Oliver Jones, Suveer Singh, Mayur Murali, Christopher Pain, Beatriz Galindo-Prieto  \n\n- **Group 5: AI in Surgery and Robotics**  \n  - Daniel Elson, Anuja Mitra, Gareth Jones, Dandan Zhang, Sen Wang, Sherwin Varghese  \n\n- **Group 6: Medical Imaging and Diagnostics**  \n  - Gina Brown, Falah Rahim, Mary-Brenda Akoda, Guang Yang, Jiansheng Xiang  \n\n- **Group 7: Molecular and Precision Medicine**  \n  - Alejandra Tomas, Frederick Tam, Weihua Zhang, Sofia Yaliraki, Mahdi Moradi Marjaneh, Juan Delgado, Oshini Shivakumar  \n\n---\n\n# Breakout Working Groups {.smaller}\n\n:::{.columns}\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n![](images/groups.png)\n:::\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n\n- **Share Ideas**: Discuss as a group potential research collaborations. What projects or problems could you tackle together? Brainstorm freely – consider combining expertise from different fields.  \n- **Think Funding**: Identify possible funding opportunities or upcoming calls that align with your ideas. How might you shape a project proposal as a team?\n- **Make\n:::\n:::\n\n---\n\n# Working Group Prompts {.smaller}\n\n- **Challenges in Your Field** – What common problems in your domain could AI help solve? Identify pain points or inefficiencies in medicine or healthcare that innovative AI approaches might address.  \n- **Interdisciplinary Collaborations** – How can team members’ diverse expertise complement each other? Explore potential cross-disciplinary projects. Look for synergies where collaboration adds value.  \n- **Funding & Proposals** – Discuss relevant funding schemes or initiatives. Are there upcoming grant calls (e.g., healthcare AI, NHS innovation) your idea fits? Consider roles, deliverables, and what would make a compelling proposal.  \n- **Ethics & Implementation** – Consider the ethical implications and real-world implementation challenges of your ideas. How will you ensure patient data privacy, accuracy, and trust in AI tools? What might be needed to deploy your solution in practice?\n\n---\n\n# Group Sharing & Discussion {.smaller}\n\n- **Group Reports**: A representative from each working group briefly shares their group’s top ideas and potential collaboration plans with everyone. Keep it to ~2 minutes per group – focus on the most exciting concepts or common themes.  \n- **Emerging Themes**: As each group presents, listen for overarching themes or connections between projects. After all groups have shared, discuss: Did multiple groups focus on similar challenges? Any surprising insights?  \n- **Facilitated Q&A**: Moderators will help kick off a discussion on these themes. Feel free to ask questions or build on another group’s idea. This is a chance to identify opportunities for broader collaboration across groups and refine ideas with input from different perspectives.\n\n---\n\n# Facilitated Networking {.smaller}\n\n- **Connect by Interests**: Seek out someone in the room you haven’t met yet, ideally from a different field, who mentioned an interest that complements yours. For example, a data scientist might chat with a clinician about a shared interest in imaging AI.  \n- **Discussion Prompts**: Consider asking: *“What did you think of the ideas we heard?”*, *“What challenges in your work could use an AI solution?”*, or *“What collaborations are you looking for?”* These prompts can help uncover mutual interests and spark partnership ideas.  \n- **Explore Synergies**: Use this time to delve deeper into possible collaborations one-on-one or in small clusters. If two groups had similar project ideas, those members could meet and compare notes. Exchange contact info with those you find synergy with.  \n- **Quick Rotations**: After about 10 minutes, feel free to move and talk to a new person, so everyone gets multiple new connections.\n\n---\n\n# Closing Remarks {.smaller}\n\n- **Summary of Insights**: Recap the key takeaways from today. What recurring ideas or challenges did we hear? Summarize the insights and innovations proposed.  \n- **Acknowledgments**: **Thank you** to all participants for your enthusiasm and contributions. Today we saw the power of bringing diverse minds together.  \n- **Next Steps**: Outline how we’ll maintain momentum after the workshop. Consider scheduling a follow-up meeting or forming small teams to develop the best ideas into real projects or joint funding applications.  \n- **Ongoing Collaboration**: Stay tuned for upcoming events or incubation opportunities. This workshop is just the beginning – let’s keep the collaboration going!\n\n---\n\n# Networking Reception {.smaller}\n\n:::{.columns}\n::: {.column width=\"60%\"}\n![](networking.png)\n:::\n::: {.column width=\"40%\"}\n- **Join Us Next Door**: The workshop formally concludes, but all are invited to the reception in the lounge area. Enjoy some refreshments (tea, wine, and snacks provided) and informal chat.  \n- **Keep Connecting**: Use this time to follow up with someone you wanted to talk to but didn’t get a chance to during the sessions. Share contact information or LinkedIn if you haven’t already.  \n- **Celebrate Collaboration**: We hope you leave with new ideas, potential partners for projects, and perhaps the seed of a proposal for advancing AI in medicine. **Thank you** for making today productive and enjoyable!  \n:::\n:::\n\n",
