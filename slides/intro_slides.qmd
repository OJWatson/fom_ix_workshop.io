::: {.column width="50%"}

- **Form Groups**: Within each group, take turns with **1-minute introductions** per person. Use any prompts (papers, slides etc on laptops) to showcase your **background, project ideas, and AI interests**.  
- **Share Ideas**: Discuss as a group potential research collaborations. What projects or problems could you tackle together? 
- **Think Funding**: Identify possible funding opportunities or upcoming calls that align with your ideas. How might you shape a project proposal as a team?

# Working Group Prompts {.smaller}

- **Challenges in Your Field** â€“ What common problems in your domain could AI help solve? Identify pain points or inefficiencies in medicine or healthcare that innovative AI approaches might address.  
- **Interdisciplinary Collaborations** â€“ How can team membersâ€™ diverse expertise complement each other? Explore potential cross-disciplinary projects. Look for synergies where collaboration adds value.  
- **Funding & Proposals** â€“ Discuss relevant funding schemes or initiatives. Are there upcoming grant calls (e.g., healthcare AI, NHS innovation) your idea fits? Consider roles, deliverables, and what would make a compelling proposal.  
- **Ethics & Implementation** â€“ Consider the ethical implications and real-world implementation challenges of your ideas. How will you ensure patient data privacy, accuracy, and trust in AI tools? What might be needed to deploy your solution in practice?

# Group Sharing & Discussion {.smaller}

- **Group Reports**: A representative from each working group briefly shares their groupâ€™s top ideas and potential collaboration plans with everyone. Keep it to ~2 minutes per group â€“ focus on the most exciting concepts or common themes.  
- **Emerging Themes**: As each group presents, listen for overarching themes or connections between projects. After all groups have shared, discuss: Did multiple groups focus on similar challenges? Any surprising insights?  
- **Facilitated Q&A**: Moderators will help kick off a discussion on these themes. Feel free to ask questions or build on another groupâ€™s idea. This is a chance to identify opportunities for broader collaboration across groups and refine ideas with input from different perspectives.

# Facilitated Networking {.smaller}

**Part 1: Meet & Pass Networking Game**

- Upon arrival, you received **a card with three participantsâ€™ names**.
- **Step 1:** Find the person on your card and introduce yourself.
- **Step 2:** Have a **3-minute conversation** using these prompts:
  - *Whatâ€™s your research focus?*
  - *What is a challenge in your research or practice?*
  - *What area of AI excites you the most in your field?*
- **Step 3:** Repeat the process with the next name on your card (for ~3 rounds).

**Part 2: Free Networking**

- Use this time to connect with people you want to talk to based on the presentations.

::: {.column width="60%"}
- **Join Us Next Door**: The workshop formally concludes, but all are invited to the reception in the lounge area. Enjoy some refreshments, informal chat and the best view in the White City Campus (in my opinion ðŸŒˆ)  
- **Keep Connecting**: Use this time to follow up with someone you wanted to talk to but didnâ€™t get a chance to during the sessions.
- **Website Resource**: We will circulate the website and a post event attendee list to help you connect again with other attendees and build from this event.
