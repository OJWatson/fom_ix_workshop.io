::: {.column width="50%"}

- **Form Groups**: Within each group, take turns with **1-minute introductions** per person. Use any prompts (papers, slides etc on laptops) to showcase your **background, project ideas, and AI interests**.  
- **Share Ideas**: Discuss as a group potential research collaborations. What projects or problems could you tackle together? 
- **Think Funding**: Identify possible funding opportunities or upcoming calls that align with your ideas. How might you shape a project proposal as a team?

# Working Group Prompts {.smaller}

- **Challenges in Your Field** – What common problems in your domain could AI help solve? Identify pain points or inefficiencies in medicine or healthcare that innovative AI approaches might address.  
- **Interdisciplinary Collaborations** – How can team members’ diverse expertise complement each other? Explore potential cross-disciplinary projects. Look for synergies where collaboration adds value.  
- **Funding & Proposals** – Discuss relevant funding schemes or initiatives. Are there upcoming grant calls (e.g., healthcare AI, NHS innovation) your idea fits? Consider roles, deliverables, and what would make a compelling proposal.  
- **Ethics & Implementation** – Consider the ethical implications and real-world implementation challenges of your ideas. How will you ensure patient data privacy, accuracy, and trust in AI tools? What might be needed to deploy your solution in practice?

# Group Sharing & Discussion {.smaller}

- **Group Reports**: A representative from each working group briefly shares their group’s top ideas and potential collaboration plans with everyone. Keep it to ~2 minutes per group – focus on the most exciting concepts or common themes.  
- **Emerging Themes**: As each group presents, listen for overarching themes or connections between projects. After all groups have shared, discuss: Did multiple groups focus on similar challenges? Any surprising insights?  
- **Facilitated Q&A**: Moderators will help kick off a discussion on these themes. Feel free to ask questions or build on another group’s idea. This is a chance to identify opportunities for broader collaboration across groups and refine ideas with input from different perspectives.

# Facilitated Networking {.smaller}

## **Part 1: Meet & Pass Networking Game**
- Upon arrival, you received **a card with three participants’ names**.
- **Step 1:** Find the person on your card and introduce yourself.
- **Step 2:** Have a **5-minute conversation** using these prompts:
  - *What’s your research focus?*
  - *What AI challenge excites you most?*
  - *If you could collaborate with someone outside your discipline, what expertise would they bring?*
- **Step 3:** Repeat the process with the next name on your card (for ~3 rounds).

## **Part 2: Free Networking**
- Use this time to connect with people you want to talk to based on the presentations.
